                    My Love ❤️<br><br>
                    A year ago, a simple conversation on Boo changed my life forever. Who knew a random chat would turn into something so deep and beautiful? Falling in love with you was the easiest thing—I don’t even know when it happened, but somewhere between our late-night talks and your sweet words, my heart became yours.<br><br>

                    Even with the miles between us, you never feel distant. You are my safe place, my happiness, and the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love your voice, your kindness, your silly jokes—even the bad ones. You make life brighter, and I wouldn’t trade this love for anything.<br><br>

                    Yes, long distance is hard. I miss you in ways I can’t even put into words. Some days, the longing feels unbearable. But no matter what, you are the one I want—always. And one day, this wait will be over. One day, I won’t have to type "I miss you" anymore because you’ll be right here beside me.<br><br>

                    Since I can’t be there with you today, I got you a small gift—a black mug with a <b>wolf (for your loyalty), a lion (for your strength), and a giraffe (for seeing beyond the distance, like our love).</b> Every time you use it, think of me. 💖<br><br>

                    <b>Happy 1st Anniversary, my love! Here’s to many more years of love, laughter, and beautiful memories.</b><br><br>

                    Forever yours, <br>
                    <b>Baby ❤️</b>
